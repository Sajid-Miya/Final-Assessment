            The programmes you study and all the materials provided are created and assessed by the University of London's member
            institutions, which have international reputations for their teaching and research. <br>
            
            When you study with us, you will join over 50,000 students in every corner of the globe studying more than 100 different
            programmes. <br>
            
            When you graduate, your prestigious University of London award will be valued globally and help you to pursue
            sought-after careers. <br>
            
            The University of London is proud of its history of global engagement since its founding in 1836. The first UK
            university to open its doors to all regardless of gender or creed, we were also the first to enable students to take our
            degrees anywhere in the world. <br>
            
            During the 20th century the University was responsible for the development of higher education systems not only in the
            UK, but also in Commonwealth countries, where our former university colleges flourish today as significant players in
            their national, regional and international higher education contexts. <br>
            
            The University of Londonâ€™s purpose has always been to pioneer unique forms of education and research that transform
            lives and society. Today, with students in 190 countries, we are a leading force in transnational higher education. <br>
            
            We educate students from all backgrounds - without regard to race or colour, nationality, national or ethnic origin,
            sex, marital status, religion, age, sexual orientation or disability. The University is committed to sharing and
            exchanging knowledge and expertise with academics, professionals, their institutions, their organisations and their
            communities as part of our societal engagement wherever this is relevant to local needs.</p>
