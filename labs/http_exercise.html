   <strong>1. What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) </strong> <br>

   Answer : Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents,
   such as HTML.<br>
   <br>
   
   <strong>2. Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol? </strong> <br>

   Answer : It is a stateless protocol, as the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. <br>
   <br>

   <strong>3. Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP</strong>
   <br>

     Answer : 1) A TCP connection is established by the client (or the appropriate connection if the transport layer
      is not TCP).<br>

      2) The client submits a request and awaits a response. <br>

      3) The server responds to the request by returning an answer with a status code and relevant data. <br>
   
   <br>

   <strong>4. Describe the parameters on a get and post request. </strong><br>

   Answer : GET : The name of the parameter and its values are present. <br>

   POST: In a data structure, the keys and values are encoded, and non-alphanumeric characters are percent encoded.<br>
   <br>

   <strong>5. What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate?</strong> <br>

   Answer : Response status codes indicate whether requests are successfully completed or not. <br>

   HTTP status code 200 - the request has succeeded. <br>

   HTTP status code 404 - the server was unable to find the requested resource. <br>

   <br>

   <strong>6. What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.</strong> <br>

   Answer : An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web
   browser. <br>

   Example :A web server might send a cookie containing the username that was last used to log into a website, so that
   it may be filled in automatically the next time the user logs in. <br>
   <br>

   <strong>7. Why are cookies a security issue?</strong> <br>

   Answer : Despite the security measures in place to ensure cookies do not fall into the hands of third parties and
   only go to the intended recipient, they can be read and modified/edited by those who have access to a client's hard disk. <br>
   <br>

   <strong>8. Describe session hijacking and XSS</strong> <br>

   Answer : Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security flaw that allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side code
   into a website. This code is later executed by the attack's victims, allowing the attacker to bypass security/access controls and
   impersonate users. An attacker's knowledge of a user's session cookie is required for session hijacking.
   After a user has been authenticated on the server side, the attacker is capable of using the session cookie to 
   hijack the session on their own browser. <br>
   <br>

   <strong>9. Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF)</strong> <br>

   Answer : Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is a web security flaw that allows an attacker to trick users into
   performing actions they do not intend to perform.It enables an attacker to partially bypass the same origin policy, which is intended to
   prevent different websites from interfering with one another. <br>
   <br>

   <strong>10. What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS?</strong> <br>

   Answer : They are requests for resources that are in a domain other than the domain of the resource making the
   request. Such requests are made by CSS Shapes from images. <br>
